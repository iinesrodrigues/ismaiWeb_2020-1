<p>
<strong>Harmeet Singh Sooden</strong> (born 1973) is a Canadian-New Zealand anti-war activist who volunteered for the international NGO Christian Peacemaker Teams in Iraq. He was held captive in Baghdad with three others for almost four months until being freed by multi-national forces on 23 March 2006.[1]

<p>
Sooden was born and raised in Zambia. His parents are Sikhs from Kashmir.[2] His great-grandfather fought for the British Indian Army in World War I and died in Basra in 1916 during the Mesopotamian Campaign.[3] As an inspiration for peace work, he cites his grandfather who was a career soldier in the British Indian Army and then the Indian Army.[4] He says he was also motivated by the experiences of a friend who survived the World Trade Center attack on 11 September 2001, and the ordeal of Maher Arar, a university classmate who was subjected to extraordinary rendition and torture.[5]

<h2>
	Christian Peacemaker Teams hostage crisis
</h2>

<hr>

<p>
Christian Peacemaker Teams (CPT) is an international organisation set up to support teams of peace workers in conflict areas around the world. One aspect of CPT's work in Iraq during the US occupation was to collect and publicise evidence of detainee abuse. Investigative journalist, Seymour Hersh of <em>The New Yorker</em> magazine, who helped to expose the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal in 2004, cited the organisation in his articles. In an interview with <em>Democracy Now</em>, he said:
</p>

<p>
I ran across them when I was looking into the torture issue at Abu Ghraib, and I remember distinctly that they were on a cutting edge. I talked to people in the organization who had been active for years in total, you know, under the radar of all of us, because they didn't have photographs. They were very interested, for example, very early on in the unwarranted use of dogs in interrogations by American troops. And most of the things that I ended up writing about in Abu Ghraib, most of the general concepts, they knew a great deal about earlier.[7]

<h3>
	Appeals for release
</h3>

<p>
Many individuals and groups asked for the hostages' release, including:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		9/11 Families for Peaceful Tomorrow, an anti-war organisation composed of survivors of the World Trade Center attacks, and friends and family members of the victims, called for the hostages' release in a press release.[11]
	</li>
	<li>
		On 5 December 2005, an online petition calling for the release of the hostages was signed by more than 13,000 people, including Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn, Arundhati Roy, Jeremy Scahill, Dahr Jamail, Denis Halliday, Tariq Ali, Cindy Sheehan, Kathy Kelly, Naomi Klein, Daniel Berrigan, Michael Ratner and the parents of Rachel Corrie.[12]
	</li>
	<li>
		On 6 December 2005, Mahmoud Jaballah, Mohammad Zeki Mahjoub and Hassan Almrei appealed for the release of the hostages. At the time, they were being detained in Canada without charge under security certificates on the suspicion of being linked to terrorist organisations and posing a threat to the national security of Canada. Of James Loney, they said, "We care about his freedom more than we do our own."[13]
